/// Given the binarized image, the next step is to find edges
/// which might form the boundary of a tag. A straightforward
/// approach is to identify edge pixels which have an opposite
/// colored neighbor, then form connected groups of edge pixels.
/// However, this approach breaks down when the white space
/// between tag boundaries approaches only a single pixel wide,
/// which may happen for physically small or faraway tags. If
/// two tag boundaries are incorrectly merged, the tags will not
/// be detected. Our proposed solution is to segment the edges
/// based on the identities of the black and white components
/// from which they arise.
/// Connected components of light and dark pixels are segmented using the union-find algorithm [15],
/// which gives each component a unique ID. For every pair of
/// adjacent black and white components, we identify the pixels
/// on the boundaries of those two regions as a distinct cluster.
/// This clustering can be done efficiently by using a hash table,
/// indexing each cluster by the black and white componentsâ€™
/// IDs, as described in Figure 4. In the aforementioned case of
/// a single pixel-wide white component separating two distinct
/// black components, we have solved the problem by allowing
/// the same white pixels to appear in both resulting clusters.
